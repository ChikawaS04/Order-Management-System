/**
 * P6-3 — fill-walk (crossing-order) benchmark. SRS §6.3: matching cost when a single
 * aggressive order walks {@code N} price levels. This closes the gap P6-1 explicitly leaves
 * open — P6-1 varied resting depth but measured a <em>non-crossing insert</em>; this measures
 * the walk itself.
 *
 * <h2>Why the engine is method-local (setup-strategy decision)</h2>
 * A crossing order drains the levels it walks, so the measured operation consumes the very
 * book the {@code @Param} sets up. The two setup strategies the guide floated both fail here:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>{@code @Setup(Level.Invocation)}</b> rebuilds N levels between timed ops, but JMH's
 *       gc profiler brackets the whole measurement iteration, so that fixture's ~165 B/level
 *       (P6-1) allocation is counted into {@code gc.alloc.rate.norm} — poisoning the
 *       allocation pass, which is the trustworthy measurement in this project. Its timing is
 *       also overhead-limited: a 1–100-level walk is 0.1–10 µs, under the ~1 ms floor where
 *       per-invocation timestamping is negligible.</li>
 *   <li><b>{@code @OperationsPerInvocation} with a pre-built book</b> drains completely on the
 *       first invocation; JMH then loops the method into an empty book for the rest of the
 *       time budget, measuring nothing.</li>
 * </ul>
 * Instead, each {@code @Benchmark} allocates a <em>fresh local</em> {@link MatchingEngine},
 * builds the book, (walks it), and discards the engine. Because the engine never persists
 * across invocations there is no shared state to drain and no JMH fixture trap; the gc
 * profiler sees exactly the method's own allocation.
 *
 * <h2>Reading the numbers (subtraction methodology, per P6-2)</h2>
 * The build is inside the timed region, so no single method reports a pure walk. The finding
 * is the <b>difference</b> {@code fillWalkAcrossLevels − buildLevelsOnly} and its slope vs N:
 * that isolates the walk's own cost. Allocation differences are precise (P6-1/P6-2 error was
 * ±1–4 B/op); timing differences are honest but wider (differencing two comparable O(N)
 * magnitudes). Scaling is technically O(N log N) — the {@link java.util.TreeMap}
 * {@code firstEntry}/{@code pollFirstEntry} per level — reported as "roughly linear" unless
 * the data resolves the log factor.
 *
 * <h2>Book shape</h2>
 * {@code N} ask levels, one resting order (qty 1) each, at prices {@code BASE_PRICE .. BASE_PRICE+N-1}.
 * One aggressor BUY priced at the top ask (so {@code askPrice <= buyPrice} at every level) with
 * qty {@code N} — best-first it fills one order per level, evicts each, and is exactly consumed
 * at level N, so nothing rests. Ids come from a method-local counter, never {@code util.IDGenerator}
 * (its {@code AtomicLong}s are JVM-global). No {@code ExecutionListener} is attached — the engine
 * defaults to {@code NO_OP}, so no execution escapes.
