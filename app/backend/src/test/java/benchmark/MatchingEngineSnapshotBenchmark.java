/**
 * P6-5 — {@code snapshotInto} allocation validation.
 *
 * <p>Settles the question P4-1 deferred to Phase 6: does
 * {@link MatchingEngine#snapshotInto(BookSnapshotEvent, int)} allocate on the hot path, or does C2
 * escape analysis scalar-replace the map/deque iterators created by its enhanced-for loops once the
 * benchmark is warm? The headline is {@code gc.alloc.rate.norm} (B/op) under {@code -Djmh.prof=gc};
 * timing is reported but is noise on an unpinned laptop.
 *
 * <p>P6-1's ~165 B/op figure does not answer this — it covers {@code addOrder}, which never calls
 * {@code snapshotInto}. This is an engine-in-isolation benchmark: {@code MatchingEngine} constructed
 * directly, no Disruptor, no Netty, no {@code ExecutionListener} (the engine defaults to
 * {@code NO_OP}).
 *
 * <p><b>Setup strategy — build once, {@code Level.Trial}.</b> Unlike P6-1/P6-3, there is no
 * book-state drift to correct: {@code snapshotInto} is read-only against the book (it reads the two
 * {@code TreeMap}s and the guarded best-bid/ask getters, writes only the target carrier, and
 * self-stamps {@code target.timestamp = System.nanoTime()} — it never mutates book structure, the
 * trade list, or {@code IDGenerator}). So the book is populated once and read on every invocation.
 *
 * <p><b>Target reuse — the production pattern, and why it must be {@code @Setup}.</b> The
 * {@link BookSnapshotEvent} target is pre-allocated once and its arrays are reused every call,
 * exactly as the ring carrier is reused in production. Allocating the target per-invocation would
 * charge four {@code long[MAX_DEPTH_LEVELS]} arrays (~384 B) to the measurement and mask the ~0 B/op
 * signal entirely. Steady-state is the only correct choice.
 *
 * <p><b>Param axis.</b> {@code bookLevels} sweeps distinct price levels <em>per side</em> — the same
 * values as P6-1 so README rows align, but note the axis differs (P6-1's param was total resting
 * orders). Levels is {@code snapshotInto}'s natural cost axis: {@code fillSide} allocates one deque
 * iterator per level walked, so if C2 fails to scalar-replace, allocation should scale with levels.
 * Both sides are populated (bids strictly below asks, non-crossing) so both {@code fillSide} calls
 * are measured. {@code maxLevels} is fixed at the production cap
 * {@link BookSnapshotEvent#MAX_DEPTH_LEVELS}; because {@code snapshotInto} clamps to
 * {@code min(maxLevels, MAX_DEPTH_LEVELS)}, the walk caps at that many levels regardless of book
 * depth. The single sweep therefore crosses all three regimes as it grows — fewer levels than the
 * cap ({@code bookLevels < cap}), equal, and more levels exist than the cap — and allocation is
 * expected to flatten once {@code bookLevels} reaches the cap.
 *
 * <p><b>DCE.</b> The benchmark returns the target carrier, whose fields {@code snapshotInto}
 * overwrites each call, so JMH consumes a real data dependency and cannot dead-code the call.
 *
 * <p>Run on JDK 21 ({@code JAVA_HOME}), {@code mvn jmh:benchmark} (plain, then
 * {@code -Djmh.prof=gc}). Ids come from a benchmark-local counter, never {@code util.IDGenerator}
 * (locked decision 4).
