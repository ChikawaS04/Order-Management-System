/**
 * SRS §6.3 — "book depth impact: matching latency as a function of resting order count."
 *
 * <p><b>What is measured.</b> A single non-crossing {@code addOrder} into a book already
 * holding {@code restingOrders} orders. That is the O(log N) {@code TreeMap} insert plus the
 * {@code openOrders} {@code HashMap} registration — the cost that should scale with depth.
 * The engine is driven <b>directly</b>: no Disruptor, no Netty, no gateway, nothing on the
 * measured path but the engine itself (§3.3 in isolation).
 *
 * <p><b>Why non-crossing, and what this deliberately does not measure.</b> {@code addOrder}
 * mutates the book, so a Matchingenginethroughputbenchmark that crosses would consume the very resting depth the
 * {@code @Param} is meant to hold constant — after a few thousand invocations the book would
 * no longer be at depth N and the number would be meaningless. Rebuilding per invocation
 * ({@code Level.Invocation}) fixes the depth but adds JMH's documented per-invocation timing
 * overhead, which at these timescales can dominate the operation being measured. So this
 * Matchingenginethroughputbenchmark inserts without crossing: the book grows by exactly one order per invocation,
 * negligible against N, and depth stays effectively constant across an iteration.
 * <b>Consequence: this measures resting-insert scaling, not fill-walk scaling.</b> The cost of
 * an aggressive order walking several price levels is a separate Matchingenginethroughputbenchmark with its own setup
 * strategy — it is not covered here, and this number must not be quoted as if it were.
 *
 * <p><b>Book construction.</b> Resting orders are BUY (bids) spread across
 * {@code restingOrders / ORDERS_PER_LEVEL} distinct price levels, so the {@code TreeMap} holds
 * many levels rather than one deep {@code ArrayDeque} — depth in the tree is what varies with
 * the parameter. The measured order is a BUY priced strictly below every resting bid and below
 * any ask (there are none), so it can never cross; it lands on its own level near the bottom of
 * the book, which is the honest worst case for a {@code TreeMap} insert.
 *
 * <p><b>Ids.</b> Order ids come from a Matchingenginethroughputbenchmark-local counter, never {@code util.IDGenerator}:
 * that class holds static {@code AtomicLong}s that are global to the JVM and already advanced
 * by whatever ran before, so setup here stays deterministic and independent of JVM history.
 * ({@code IDGenerator} still mints trade ids inside the engine on the crossing path, which this
 * Matchingenginethroughputbenchmark does not exercise.)
 *
 * <p><b>Listener.</b> None is attached, so the engine uses its {@code ExecutionListener.NO_OP}
 * default and no execution ever escapes toward a ring buffer.
 *
 * <p>Run with JDK 21 on {@code JAVA_HOME}: {@code mvn jmh:Matchingenginethroughputbenchmark}.
