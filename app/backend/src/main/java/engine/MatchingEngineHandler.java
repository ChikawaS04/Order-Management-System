/**
 * Adapts MatchingEngine onto the Disruptor: consumes OrderEvent from the inbound
 * ring buffer and produces ExecutionEvent onto the outbound ring buffer. Sole
 * outbound producer (SRS §3.3), so the outbound ring is ProducerType.SINGLE.
 *
 * onEvent builds the Order from the OrderEvent — THIS is where domain validation
 * fires (the Order constructor throws on bad fields), since the parser
 * deliberately never builds an Order. Match executions are reported back via the
 * ExecutionListener callbacks and published from there.
 *
 * P4-2: also the sole producer of the SNAPSHOT ring. After each inbound event is
 * processed, it reads a bounded depth snapshot off the engine (safe — this is the
 * engine thread) and publishes it. Two rings, one producer, one thread: both stay
 * SINGLE.
 *
 * The injectable clock mirrors the OrderGateway seam (Step 7) for deterministic
 * tests and future JMH timestamping (SRS §6.3). It stamps BOTH outbound streams.
