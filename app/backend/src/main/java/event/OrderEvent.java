/**
 * Mutable carrier for the inbound ring buffer (gateway -> matching engine).
 *
 * Pre-allocated once per Disruptor slot and reused: the gateway writes the
 * fields, the engine reads them. Deliberately framework-free (no com.lmax,
 * no io.netty) so both the pure FixParser and the Disruptor can depend on it
 * without either side leaking into the other.
 *
 * Public mutable fields are intentional — this is a value carrier on the hot
 * path, not an encapsulated domain object. Every field a message uses is
 * written before the slot is published, so there is no half-initialised read.
