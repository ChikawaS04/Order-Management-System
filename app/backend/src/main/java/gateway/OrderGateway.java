/**
 * Inbound ring-buffer producer: the boundary between the FIX wire and the SRS
 * hot path.
 *
 * One frame in (a complete, length-framed FIX message that FixFrameDecoder has
 * already copied to a fresh byte[]), one of two outcomes:
 *   - valid   -> stamped with a receipt timestamp and published onto the inbound
 *                RingBuffer<OrderEvent> for the matching engine;
 *   - invalid -> logged once at this boundary (SRS §5.4) and dropped. No feedback
 *                path to the client in this demo (locked decision).
 *
 * Boundary discipline:
 *   - Sole producer on the inbound ring (single-writer, SRS §5.2), so
 *     ProducerType.SINGLE is safe and {@link #onFrame} is NOT thread-safe:
 *     exactly one thread (the Netty event loop, or a test thread) may call it.
 *   - Imports com.lmax (it *is* the ring producer) but deliberately NOT io.netty:
 *     the decoder already handed off a plain byte[] copy, so no Netty refcount
 *     discipline leaks in. The decoder->gateway adapter is Phase 4, not this class.
 *
 * Zero allocation on the accept path: parser, parse target (scratch), and publish
 * translator are all pre-allocated and reused. No per-message lambda, no String,
 * no boxing.
