/**
 * Outbound client frame builders and the client-owned ClOrdID source.
 *
 * clOrdId is client-owned, numeric, and monotonic. The counter is seeded at
 * Date.now() so a page reload cannot collide with orders still resting on the
 * server from before the refresh, and every outbound message (cancels included)
 * consumes an id. It is generated in exactly one place and never derived from
 * server data.
 *
 * P7-7 adds a non-consuming peek() to the generator so the order ticket can show
 * the id the next send will use WITHOUT advancing the sequence. Only a call to
 * the generator itself consumes an id; peek() never does. Generation stays here;
 * the ticket only reads and displays the peeked value.
