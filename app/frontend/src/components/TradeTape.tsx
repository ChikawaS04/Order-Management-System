/**
 * Trade tape (SRS §3.7), refined in P7-6 into a real time-and-sales.
 *
 * Still purely presentational and single-slice: it takes only the reducer's
 * `tape` slice and owns no socket, hook, or reducer access. The reducer remains
 * the sole authority on what enters the tape (fills only, newest-first, capped at
 * TAPE_CAP), so this component never sorts or caps; the only state it owns is view
 * state (a block-size filter and a clock-precision toggle), and the filter / tick
 * maths are pure exported helpers (mirroring buildLadder), tested separately.
 *
 * What P7-6 adds, and the limits it states rather than hides:
 *
 *  - Wall-clock time column. TapeEntry.timestamp is epoch nanoseconds since P7-1
 *    (one shared clock across the wire), so it renders as local HH:MM:SS.mmm with
 *    a precision toggle extending to full nanoseconds. The P5-3 "no wall-clock"
 *    limit is retired. Precision limit, stated in formatClockNanos: below roughly a
 *    microsecond the digits reflect JSON-number (IEEE-754) transport rounding, not
 *    engine truth.
 *
 *  - Aggressor side, at the only fidelity the wire supports. No EXEC frame carries
 *    a side, so it is derivable only for trades touching one of this client's own
 *    orders (aggressorSide on TapeEntry, computed in the reducer where myOrders is
 *    in scope). That set is exactly the `mine` set, so a BUY/SELL tag appears on the
 *    focus-blue own-trade rows and anonymous prints show none. Shown as plain text,
 *    never a green/red colour, so it never competes with the tick colour or mine.
 *
 *  - Tick colouring: each print's price is coloured against the previous print (the
 *    older neighbour in this newest-first slice) — up green, down red, equal flat.
 *    Equal consecutive prices are pure flat (no zero-tick carry): the colour says
 *    "did THIS print move the price," and a repeat did not. The mine focus-blue wins
 *    on own rows.
 *
 *  - Block-size filters (all / >200 / >500), strict-greater, applied at render over
 *    the already-capped newest-first slice, so filtering preserves order and the cap
 *    and adds no reaccumulation.
 *
 * Prices go through format.ts; a -1 would render as EMPTY_PRICE, never a negative.
 * The P5-3 class/testid hooks and the `--mine` marker are preserved.
