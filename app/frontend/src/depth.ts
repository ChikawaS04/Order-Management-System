/**
 * Pure depth-book helpers shared across the depth panels.
 *
 * `cumulate` (with `CumLevel`) began as a private function in DepthLadder.tsx;
 * P7-5 lifts it here so the ladder and the depth curve share one definition of
 * running cumulative quantity rather than each carrying its own copy. Both sides
 * of the book arrive best-first (bids highest-first, asks lowest-first), so a
 * plain left-to-right fold accumulates outward from the touch on either side.
 *
 * `buildDepthCurve` is the P7-5 curve model: a cumulative-depth STEP function per
 * side, in domain units (integer cents, integer cumulative quantity). It emits no
 * pixels; the component maps points to an SVG viewBox at the render edge, exactly
 * as buildLadder emits a 0..1 fraction and lets the component size the bar. Cents
 * stay integers here; only the SVG scales touch float, later, in the component.
